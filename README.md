Writeamultithreadedsortingprogramthatworksasfollows:Alistofintegers isdividedintotwosmallerlistsofequalsize.Two separatethreads(which we will term sorting threads) sort each sublist using a sorting algorithm of your choice. The two sublists are then merged by a third thread—a merging thread —which mergesthe two sublists into a single sorted list. Because global data are shared cross all threads, perhaps the easiest way to set up the data is to create a global array. Each sorting thread will work on one half of this array. A second global array of the same size as the unsorted integer array will also be established. The merging thread will then merge the two sublists into this second array. Graphically, this program is structured according to Figure 4.20. This programming project will require passing parameters to each of the sorting threads.In particular, itwill be necessaryto identifythe starting index from which each thread is to begin sorting. Refer to the instructions in Project 1 for detailson passing parametersto a thread. Theparentthreadwilloutputthesortedarrayonceallsortingthreadshave exited.
